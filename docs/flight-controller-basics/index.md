# Flight controller basics

The Flight Lab's standard control setup uses [CubePilot](https://www.cubepilot.com/#/home) hardware running [Ardupilot](https://ardupilot.org/ardupilot/).

Expand, adding some stuff about basic platforms, links to quickstart guides, etc.

Maybe also HereLink, standard recommended cameras, other stuff?
